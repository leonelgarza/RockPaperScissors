                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Is a hand game originating from China, back to the time of the Han dynasty (206 BCE â€“ 220 CE), played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V)</p>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p>It has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss</p>
                <p>You have to select between Rock, Paper or Scissors (as you can see in the image below)</p>
                <div class = "instructions-card"><img src="Rock-paper-scissors.png"/></div>
                <p>A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock breaks scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper").</p>
                <p>If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.</p>
                <p>Unlike truly random selection methods, however, rock paper scissors can be played with a degree of skill by recognizing and exploiting non-random behavior in opponents</p>
